title: Welcome
welcome_text: Protein biosynthesis is a fundamental process in which genetic
  information is translated into functional cellular proteome. The key players
  are aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the enzymes that read the genetic code by
  linking the cognate pairs of amino acids and tRNAs for the ribosome. We
  investigate the mechanisms by which aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases establish high
  aminoacylation accuracy and their capacity to act as antibiotic targets.
