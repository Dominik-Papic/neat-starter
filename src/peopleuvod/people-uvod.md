description: During the years, many people passed through our laboratory. Some
  of them became successful independent group leaders, started postdoctoral
  research or continued their career in industry (see Alumni). Currently, we
  work on four major research topics and employ various techniques using modern
  instrumentation. Motivated Bachelor or Master students, PhD students, and
  Postdocs that are eager to work in the fascinating field of aminoacyl-tRNA
  synthetases are always welcome.
