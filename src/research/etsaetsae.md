title: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase â€“ mechanisms, quality control and physiology
description: >-
  Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) provide a unique model for studying the
  evolution of

  enzyme selectivity. The Achilles heel of AARS selectivity, which is the rejection of non-

  cognate amino acids at the first encounter, has been addressed by the evolution of editing

  that clears misrecognized amino acids in the synthetic (pre-transfer editing) and editing

  (post-transfer editing) active sites. The specificity for a large tRNA substrate, in contrast,

  relies on the acquisition of a specific tRNA-binding domain. Using biochemical, genetic and

  enzyme kinetic approaches we aim to understand how AARS selectivity evolved addressing

  fundamental questions related to the evolution of proteins and biocatalysis. By studying the

  consequences of AARS errors at the cellular level, we aim to relate requirements for high

  fidelity with mechanistic solutions evolved to establish the mandatory level of AARS

  selectivity.
