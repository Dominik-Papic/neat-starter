title: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase - antibiotic targets and evolved resistance
description: >-
  Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are fundamental for life and therefore
  suitable targets

  for natural and man-made antibiotics. Our recent finding that hyper-resistance to antibiotic

  mupirocin occurs through natural variation of the most conserved catalytic motif (the HIGH

  motif) at the IleRS active site without compromising the enzymeâ€™s housekeeping function

  raises new questions about AARS function and evolution. We aim to explore trade-offs

  associated with antibiotic (hyper)resistance as well as to identify novel AARS inhibitors

  among bacterial natural products.
